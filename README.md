# Rain prediction in Australia


This repository contains the files and notebook for building a logistic regression classification model on the rain in Australia dataset


## Tool Used
I used the Python programming language (version 3.10.8) to carry out this project. In particular, I use the following libraries:
- Numpy (1.26.2): For numerical computations.
- Pandas (2.1.4): For the Dataframe and some analysis thereof.
- Matplotlib (3.8.2): For visualizations
- Seaborn (0.13.0): For visualizations
- Scikit-Learn (1.4.0): For data preprocessing, model building and metrics checking.
- Joblib (1.3.2): For saving the model and preprocessed data and variables
- Plotly (5.18.0): For visualizations

## Procedure
- I gave a brief overview of logistic regression
- Explored the data and made some visualisations
- Imputed the missing values
- Split the data into training and test sets
- Standardized numerical features
- Encoded categorical variables
- Trained the model and made predictions on the test set
